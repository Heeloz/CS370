I developed the code for the reinforcement learning algorithm. I also wrote the game loops utilizing Keras and Tensorflow to find the most optinal path solution. I was given the code for the game set up which is GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py.

A computer scientist is one that is solving problems with computational solutions. These solutions could include tools already available or needing to develop their own tools. A computer scientist's role in society is important to the advancements of computational technologies such as PCs, PCBs, and ML to name a few. As a computer sciencitist, I leverage my current tech knowledge, resources and tools to solve problems. When first reviewing a problem, I break it down into smaller parts then tackle each smaller task till the whole problem is solved or completed. Lastly, my ethical responsibilities to others is to always do the right thing. Don't create or design harmful applications or systems.
